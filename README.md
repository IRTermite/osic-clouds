# OSIC User Tools
Join **#osic-clouds** on Freenode IRC to get access to your Community Managers and other OSIC Community Members to help each other with your projects and cluster usage troubleshooting.

Find helpful tools and more at [https://github.com/osic/osic-clouds](https://github.com/osic/osic-clouds "GitHub Repo for OSIC-Clouds")

Don't have your own multi-node and cloud deployment method? You are welcome to use the same tool that we have developed to re-base the environments for handing off to the next user. This set of instructions and scripts is NOT a supported tool with any kind of SLA; it is merely provided as a good faith use tool.
